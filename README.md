# Soplex

Lean verified certificate checking for [SoPlex](https://soplex.zib.de/), the linear programming solver from the SCIP optimization suite.

This repository (`kim-em/soplex`) is the high-level Lean package. It
sits on top of [`kim-em/soplex-ffi`](https://github.com/kim-em/soplex-ffi),
which owns the vendored SoPlex build, the C++ FFI wrapper, and the
direct Lean bindings. On top of that, `Soplex` adds:

* a **pure-Lean certificate checker** (`Soplex.Verify`);
* `solveVerified`, a driver that runs SoPlex and validates its exact
  certificate against the original problem before returning a
  proof-carrying result;
* exact-mode and floating-point LP solves, plus MPS / LP file I/O
  (re-exported from `SoplexFFI`);
* fast user tactics `lp` (which handles quantifier elimination) and `maximize`.

## Quickstart

Add `Soplex` to your `lakefile.lean`:

```lean
require Soplex from git "https://github.com/kim-em/soplex" @ "main"
```

This example maximizes `3 x₀ + 5 x₁` subject to
`x₀ ≤ 4`, `2 x₁ ≤ 12`, `3 x₀ + 2 x₁ ≤ 18`, and `x₀, x₁ ≥ 0`
(textbook example; optimum is `x = (2, 6)` with objective `36`):

```lean
import Soplex
open Soplex Soplex.Verify

-- Proving theorems via `lp` is usually faster than Mathlib's `linarith`.
example (x₀ x₁ : Rat) (_ : x₀ ≤ 4) (_ : 2 * x₁ ≤ 12) (_ : 3 * x₀ + 2 * x₁ ≤ 18)
    (_ : 0 ≤ x₀) (_ : 0 ≤ x₁) : 3 * x₀ + 5 * x₁ ≤ 36 := by lp

-- The tactic also solves linear arithmetic problems involving quantifiers.
example : ∃ x : Rat, 0 ≤ x ∧ x ≤ 3 ∧
    ∀ y : Rat, x ≤ y → y ≤ 5 → y ≤ 2 * x := by lp

-- The library can also generate certificates for linear programming problems:

def lp : Problem 3 2 :=
  { c         := #v[3, 5]
    a         := #[(0, 0, 1), (1, 1, 2), (2, 0, 3), (2, 1, 2)]
    rowBounds := #v[(none, some 4), (none, some 12), (none, some 18)]
    colBounds := #v[(some 0, none), (some 0, none)] }

def main : IO Unit := do
  match solveVerified (opts := { sense := .maximize }) lp with
  | .error e  => IO.println s!"solve failed: {repr e}"
  | .ok r =>
    match r.verified with
    | .optimal x h =>
      -- `h.1 : IsFeasible r.normalized x.toArray`
      -- `h.2 : IsOptimal  r.normalized .maximize x.toArray`
      let _ := h
      IO.println s!"optimal x = {repr x.toArray}"
    | .infeasible _    => IO.println "infeasible (with Lean proof)"
    | .unbounded _ _ _ => IO.println "unbounded (with Lean proof)"
    | .unchecked s     => IO.println s!"unchecked: {repr s}"
```

Key shape:

* `Problem m n` is indexed by `m` constraints and `n` variables, so
  every array has its size pinned in the type. `c`, `rowBounds`,
  `colBounds` are `Vector`s; `a` is a sparse `(row, col, value)` list.
* `rowBounds` and `colBounds` are `(lo, hi)` pairs with `none = ±∞`,
  covering `≤`, `=`, `≥`, ranged constraints, and boxed variables
  uniformly.
* `solveVerified` returns a `VerifiedSolve` whose `verified` field is
  either a constructor carrying a real Lean soundness proof
  (`.optimal x h`, `.infeasible h`, `.unbounded x r h`) or
  `.unchecked status` when SoPlex was undecided or the certificate
  failed to check.

This example is kept in [`Examples/Quickstart.lean`](./Examples/Quickstart.lean)
and built as `lake exe quickstart-example` so it stays in sync with
the API.

## Tactics

The verified pipeline is exposed as two `Rat`-affine tactics that
build kernel proof terms — no `Problem`/`Certificate` data reaches the
kernel, only a weighted-sum-of-hypotheses identity discharged by an
explicit-proof-term constructor.

### `lp` 

```lean
import Soplex

example : (1 : Rat) < 2 := by lp

example (a b : Rat) (_ : 2 * a + b ≤ 5) (_ : a - b ≤ 1) :
    3 * a ≤ 6 := by lp

example (a : Rat) (_ : a ≤ 0 ∧ 0 ≤ a) : a = 0 := by lp

example (x : Rat) (_ : x ≤ 0) : x < 1 := by lp

example : ∃ x : Rat, 0 ≤ x ∧ x ≤ 1 := by lp

example : ∃ x : Rat, ∀ y : Rat, 0 ≤ y → y ≤ 1 → x ≥ y := by lp

example : ∃ x : Rat, 0 ≤ x ∧ x ≤ 3 ∧
    ∀ y : Rat, x ≤ y → y ≤ 5 → y ≤ 2 * x := by lp
```

Hypotheses that are not non-strict `Rat`-affine are silently ignored
(strict hypotheses are rejected with a tactic-level diagnostic). When
SoPlex returns infeasible, `lp` derives `False` from the dual and
closes any goal.

`lp` handles a Π₂ fragment of linear rational arithmetic. Atoms are
`Rat`-affine (in)equalities (`≤`, `<`, `=`, `≥`, `>`) in the
`Rat`-typed locals; these combine under `∧`, under `∃ x : Rat`, and
under inner `∀ y : Rat, g₁ → … → gₖ → b` whose guards `gᵢ` and body
`b` are themselves `Rat`-affine atoms — including guards that mention
the outer existential witness. The local context contributes
non-strict linear `Rat` hypotheses; SoPlex serves as an untrusted
oracle for Farkas / dual multipliers, and the kernel proof is
reconstructed from those multipliers and the original hypothesis
terms.

### `maximize` 

`maximize <expr>` runs a sup-LP over the local hypotheses and injects
`hbound : <expr> ≤ N` where `N` is the certified maximum. Use
`maximize h : <expr>` to choose the hypothesis name.

```lean
example (x₀ x₁ : Rat) (_ : 0 ≤ x₀) (_ : 0 ≤ x₁) (_ : x₀ ≤ 4)
    (_ : 2 * x₁ ≤ 12) (_ : 3 * x₀ + 2 * x₁ ≤ 18) :
    3 * x₀ + 5 * x₁ ≤ 36 := by
  maximize 3 * x₀ + 5 * x₁
  exact hbound

example (x : Rat) (_ : 0 ≤ x) (_ : x ≤ 4) : 3 * x + 7 ≤ 19 := by
  maximize h : 3 * x + 7
  exact h
```

If hypotheses are inconsistent, `maximize` closes the surrounding
goal by `False.elim`. If the LP is unbounded above, it fails without
producing a proof.

## Build

Pinned SoPlex tag: **`v8.0.2`** (transitive via `SoplexFFI`). Pinned
Lean toolchain: see [`lean-toolchain`](./lean-toolchain).

System dependencies:

| Platform | Packages |
|----------|----------|
| Linux    | `build-essential cmake libgmp-dev libgmpxx4ldbl libboost-dev` |
| macOS    | `brew install gmp boost cmake` (plus Xcode Command Line Tools) |
| Windows  | MSYS2 `mingw-w64-x86_64-{gcc,cmake,ninja,make,gmp,boost}` |

Clone and build through Lake:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kim-em/soplex
cd soplex
lake exe quickstart-example
lake test
```

Lake fetches `SoplexFFI` and initializes its vendored SoPlex submodule
as part of the build — there are no submodules in this repository
itself.

`quickstart-example` runs the verified solve from the
[Quickstart](#quickstart) above and prints `optimal x = #[2, 6]`.
`lake test` builds and runs the full test suite under
[`SoplexTest/`](./SoplexTest). The suite includes
`SoplexTest/FFIProbe.lean`, which calls `solveVerified` from inside a
tactic and checks the elaboration-time FFI loading path used by future
tactics. For a lower-level FFI-only check
(SoPlex version, throw/catch ABI, toy LP via the direct binding) use
`lake exe ffi-check`.

The first Lake build is slow (~1–3 min) because the `SoplexFFI`
dependency configures and compiles vendored SoPlex with CMake.
Subsequent runs are nearly instant: CMake reuses its cache, and Lake
only rebuilds the FFI wrapper or extracted SoPlex objects when their
inputs change.

## Trust model

SoPlex is treated as an unverified mathematical oracle. Every exact
certificate it produces is checked in Lean before any proof is
constructed. Incorrect certificates, including certificates affected by
solver bugs or sign-convention translation mistakes, are rejected by
the Lean checker and reported as `Verified.unchecked`.

The native C++ FFI remains part of the runtime trusted computing base.
It is trusted to run safely in-process, preserve memory safety and ABI
correctness, and faithfully marshal Lean-side `Problem` and
certificate data. The Lean checker protects the mathematical proof
boundary; it does not make arbitrary native memory-safety or ABI
failures harmless.

Detailed notes on `solveVerified`, presolve, dual multipliers,
maximization canonicalization, and denominator budgets are maintained
in [`docs/verification.md`](./docs/verification.md).
